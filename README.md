# Challenge-1

Bootcamp assignment 1

## Description

I wanted to create an easily readable file using HTML semantics, reorganize the code, as well as add accesibility features. I built this code to ensure anyone with screen readers was able to effectively access and utilize this website. I solved the accessibility issue and created a more streamlined code that will make it easier for other developers to work in and read. I learned to restructure CSS in a logical way that corresponds with the HTML file making each easier to navigate while making changes.
